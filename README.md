# Flight-Delay-Analysis
EDA and random forest forcast on flight delay rate


### Executive Summary ###
This report presents an in-depth analysis of flight delays in US airports for 2021, using a
structured dataset of 1.89 GB. The study focuses on factors such as airlines, months, departure
locations, and shared partner flights, aiming to identify patterns in flight delays. Utilizing
PySpark and Random Forest algorithms, the analysis highlights the variance in delay
frequencies among different airlines and months, and the impact of departure locations and
shared partner flights. In addition, this analysis uses random forest to predict the likelihood of
delay given certain factors. The findings are intended to guide travelers and stakeholders in
making informed decisions to minimize delays, thereby enhancing efficiency and reliability in
air travel. The recommendations provided are based on data-driven insights, offering practical
solutions to common travel dilemmas such as choosing between airlines for timely arrivals.
